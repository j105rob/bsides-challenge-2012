INSTALLING
----------

I'll write this up properly at some point. You need apache2, php5, mysql5-server, php5-gd, php5-mcrypt, redis (see our blog post at http:/blog.7elements.co.uk for installation notes)....maybe some other stuff.

Create the MySQL db:

1) mysql -u root -P '<your mysql root password>'

CREATE DATABASE bsides
GRANT SELECT ON bsides.* TO bsides@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'BS1d3$L0nd0N'

then exit mysql client

2) Import the schema/data

mysql -u root -P '<your mysql root password>' bsides < db/bsides.sql

3) Set up Redis and copy the dump.rdb into the /var/lib/redis/6379/

/etc/init.d/redis_6379 stop (it's important it has actually stopped)
cp db/dump.rdb /var/lib/redis/6379/
chown redis:redis /var/lib/redis/6379/dump.rdb
/etc/init.d/redis_6379 start

4) If you've installed it anywhere other than /var/www/bsides you will need to update the ZeDuLcNi/common.php file and change the value of SITE_ROOT to match.

5) If you are Chrooting Apache (and you should) then remember the paths Apache sees are relative to the chroot environment.

6) Make sure that the webserver user (probably www-data if on Debian/Ubuntu) can write to the uploads/images directory. In this example I'm actually making it so the www-data group can write to it. I prefer the ownership to stay with root.

chown root:www-data uploads/images
chmod 775 uploads/images

7) Rename the directory _rename_this_to_.git to .git

mv _rename_this_to_.git .git

That's about it, go have fun.
